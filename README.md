# Completely Messed Up Filesystem (CMUF)

A project similar to the big list of naughty strings https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings

The idea being to replicate all sorts of intersting filesytem possibilies that your program might run into so that if you are doing file parsing you can debug and step though all the quirks.
